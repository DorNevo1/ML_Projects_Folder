Music Century Classification\n","#### Dor Nevo 209498450\n","For this task, we will construct models to predict the century in which a music piece was released. We will utilize the \"YearPredictionMSD Data Set,\" which is derived from the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Make sure you download the version of the dataset from the moodle and not from UCI.

This file (ML_DL_Assignment2.ipynb)\n","2. A python functions  file which you will fill out (ML_DL_Functions2.py)\n","\n","As well as the year prediction msd dataset file.\n","\n","In this assignment you will mount and load the dataset and functions file from google drive. To start make sure you have both the template python functions file and the song dataset file(downloaded from the moodle) on the same directory in your google drive.\n","\n","When you are finished with the assignment make sure you submit the following files:\n","1. this file (ML_DL_Assignment2.ipynb).\n","2. the functions file (ML_DL_Functions2.py).\n","3. the weights file from section 2.7 (assignment2_submission_optimal_weights.npy).\n","4. the bias file from section 2.7 (assignment2_submission_optimal_bias.npy).\n","\n","\n","Note that untill section 2.9 you are not allowed to import additional packages **(especially not PyTorch)**. One of the objectives is to understand how the training procedure actually operates, before working with PyTorch's autograd engine which does it all for us. Importing the pytorch package will deduct from your points."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"47oq1vy5PUIV"},"source":["## 1.
