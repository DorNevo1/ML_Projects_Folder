        "In this assignment, we will build models to predict student's performance. We will be using the \"Student Performance Dataset\" a dataset which includes student grades, demographic, social and school related features that has been collected by using school reports and questionnaires.\n",

In the first part of the assignment you will be writing a linear regression model to predict the students grade at the end of the year. In the second part of the assignment you will build a classifier which predicts if the student's performance at the end of the year will be above average.\n",

Do not change the files names(ML_DL_Assignment1.zip, and ML_DL_Functions1.py) when submitting. This is crucial and can cause your code to fail in the testing."
