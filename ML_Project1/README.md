## Linear regression to predict student's performance.
Our target value will be the student's performance in the end of the year which is marked 'G3' in the dataset. In the first part of the assignment you will be writing a linear regression model to predict the students grade at the end of the year. In the second part of the assignment you will build a classifier which predicts if the student's performance at the end of the year will be above average.
